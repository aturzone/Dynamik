Armitazh Construction Project:
Description:
The Armitazh project is a luxurious residential complex being constructed in one of the most prominent areas of the city. This project consists of several towers with varying heights, each designed to offer its own independent amenities and services. One of the unique features of this project is its modern design and the use of the highest quality materials throughout the construction process, ensuring the comfort and convenience of the residents with advanced technologies. The residential units range from 2-bedroom to 4-bedroom apartments, each with interior designs that combine both beauty and functionality. All units are equipped with smart systems, allowing residents to control heating, cooling, lighting, and security systems via mobile devices. Surrounding the complex is a vast green space with walking paths, children’s play areas, and peaceful recreational zones. Additionally, residents will have access to both outdoor and indoor swimming pools, gyms, and other recreational facilities. The project incorporates water filtration systems and utilizes solar energy to meet part of the building’s energy needs, ensuring environmental sustainability. The project is centrally located, offering easy access to shopping centers, cultural facilities, and public transportation. The exterior design of the project is such that the building's façade is illuminated at night, making it an architectural landmark in the region. The Armitazh project is scheduled to be completed in three years, and given its prime location, it is expected to become one of the most prominent projects in the city. Currently, there are 200 workers involved in the construction of this project.

Hypothetical Incidents:

Incident in the installation of glass façade: During one phase of installing the building's glass façade, a glass panel broke due to non-compliance with safety standards in crane usage. Fortunately, no workers were injured. This incident led to a temporary halt of construction on several floors while safety protocols were reviewed and improved.

Delay in material supply: Due to issues in securing specific materials required for the building’s exterior design, the project timeline was delayed by approximately three months. This caused scheduling conflicts in the final stages of the project and led to changes in the completion phases.

Sky Construction Project:
Description:
The Sky project is a mixed-use commercial and residential tower being constructed in the heart of the central district of the city. This 30-story tower will house luxury residential units, modern office spaces, and commercial areas. The project aims to create an integrated living and working environment so that residents and businesses can benefit from the advantages of living in a unified space. The design of the Sky Tower is based on modern technologies and high-quality materials, with the building’s façade featuring sun- and wind-resistant glass, giving it a sleek and contemporary appearance. The interior design maximizes natural light and creates a comfortable, peaceful environment for residents. The project also includes smart building systems, such as automatic lighting control, ventilation, security, and access management for the convenience of the residents. At the top of the building, a dedicated recreational space, complete with a café and outdoor swimming pool, will offer residents panoramic views of the city. The commercial spaces and office suites are designed to provide up-to-date amenities, creating an efficient and productive environment for businesses. The Sky project is aimed at becoming a major commercial and residential hub in the heart of the city and is set to be completed in five years. Its proximity to public transport systems, shopping centers, and cultural venues further enhances its attractiveness as one of the key urban development projects. Currently, there are 150 workers involved in the construction of this project.

Hypothetical Incidents:

Minor earthquake in the region: During the installation of the steel frame, a minor earthquake occurred in the region, causing a slight shake in the initial structure. The incident was quickly addressed by the engineering team, reinforcing the building’s structure and adhering to safety protocols. This event resulted in a one-month delay in completing the first phase of the project.

Electricity supply issues: Early in the construction phase, there were issues with electricity supply to the building’s equipment, caused by the insufficient infrastructure in the area. Due to the need to upgrade the local power grid, the project was delayed by two months.

Hypothetical Incidents:

Flood caused by heavy rainfall: During one phase of construction, heavy rainfall led to flooding in some of the project’s underground infrastructure areas. This caused damage to temporary water systems and led to a temporary suspension of construction. The technical team quickly took action to repair the water systems and prevent further damage.

Fire during finishing stage: While electrical systems were being installed on one of the floors, a small fire broke out due to failure to adhere to safety standards when connecting certain electrical wires. Thankfully, no injuries were reported. However,
