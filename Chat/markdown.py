Based on the project details provided for Armitaj, Baran, and Mahtab building constructions, several tasks can be identified that typically carry higher risks:\n\n## High-Risk Tasks in Construction Projects\n\n1. **Excavation and Site Preparation**: This phase involves significant earthmoving activities, which can lead to accidents if not managed properly. Risks include cave-ins, equipment accidents, and exposure to hazardous materials ([Procore](https://www.procore.com/library/earthwork-construction), [Procore](https://www.procore.com/library/construction-site-logistics)).\n\n2. **Superstructure Construction**: Erecting the framework of the buildings involves working at heights, which poses risks of falls, equipment failures, and structural collapses. Proper safety measures and equipment are crucial to mitigate these risks ([Procore](https://www.procore.com/library/construction-site-management)).\n\n3. **Material Handling**: The logistics of moving heavy materials such as steel and concrete can lead to injuries from lifting, falling objects, and equipment mishaps. Effective training and use of appropriate equipment are essential to reduce these risks ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_handling), [Procore](https://www.procore.com/library/construction-site-logistics)).\n\n4. **Roofing and External Works**: This phase includes tasks performed at significant heights, increasing the risk of falls and accidents. Adhering to safety protocols and utilizing fall protection systems is vital ([Procore](https://www.procore.com/library/construction-site-management)).\n\n5. **Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP) Works**: These tasks involve handling potentially dangerous systems and materials, which can lead to electrical shocks, explosions, or other hazards if not executed with care ([Procore](https://www.procore.com/library"""
